What started as special event lighting  for the annual Elkhart Jazz Festival quickly morphed into a custom light and sound experience that INOVA could share with the community at large. An illumination of vibrant color and unparalleled sound that would create another branch of memories that will last a lifetime.<\/strong><\/p><p>It started when Shawn Saros’ sister company, Events by ProShow received a call from INOVA Federal to set up lights for the annual jazz festival. After the event was over, another call quickly followed to overhaul their outdoor fixtures and design an adaptive, engaging new system.<\/p><p>“INOVA’s CEO loved the green wash that was set up on the building, but he wanted more,” said Shawn. “I’ve been a Blizzard customer since the beginning and have always loved the flexibility and design of their products. The quality of the products and the support that is only a phone call away is something that I’ve always appreciated.”<\/p>",

The team had a 4th floor ledge to work with and designed an angled mounting flange to fit into the walls existing soffits so the lights would point downward instead of outward.<\/p><p>Day-to-day, the system runs on a schedule of green lights, but for special events the team can design more sophisticated shows. This came in handy during the annual Elkhart Jazz Festival when Bruce Hornsby & The Noisemakers performed, and the team was able to put on a light and audio show to “The Way It Is.”<\/p>",
