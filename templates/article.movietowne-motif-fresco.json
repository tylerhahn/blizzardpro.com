Derek’s dream of a high-quality space for family entertainment became a reality in November 2002 with the opening of the ten-screen MovieTowne Port of Spain.<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>Over the years, steady growth called for the opening of the Chaguanas location (8 screens); Tobago (4 screens); and San Fernando (9 screens). Having grown up in Guyana, Derek, now Chairman, set his eyes on turning MovieTowne into a regional brand by bringing it back to his homeland.<\/strong><\/p><p>With four locations under its belt, the MovieTowne group knew it needed to up its game. A budget of $40 million was assigned to the mall + cinema project, and decisions were not being left to chance. The AVL installation experts at Streamline Systems were called in to work with the design team to create a mythical world where dragons would be featured in the theater’s lobby. Michael Pereira, Director of Streamline Systems, took charge of the project and spent weeks bouncing ideas & concepts around with designer Roger Myers, of Myers Design Services. Seeing the lobby, they knew if there was ever an opportunity to light a setting in far out colors, this was it!<\/p>",

Blizzard Lighting’s Motif Sketch features 7x3W RGB LEDs & is also IP65-rated for outdoor use.<\/p><p>While independent DMX control of fixtures offers ample chases movement, Pereira wanted one last effect, a bit of a surprise to really catch some eyes. The team installed two Blizzard Lighting <a href=\"https:\/\/www.blizzardpro.com\/products\/g-mix-200\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https:\/\/www.blizzardpro.com\/products\/g-mix-200\"><strong>G-Mix™ 200<\/strong><\/a> moving spots for CMY color mixing, plus custom-made Rosco gobos to show off the MovieTowne logo, visible amongst the lobby trees or while moving gracefully across the floor.<\/p>",

Streamline returned to Blizzard Lighting, installing 20 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.blizzardpro.com\/products\/motif-vignette\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https:\/\/www.blizzardpro.com\/products\/motif-vignette\"><strong>Motif™ Vignette<\/strong><\/a> linear fixtures (18x 10W RGB+WW LEDs) in a double line to ensure adequate brightness & chase control via DMX.<\/p><p>Pereira’s team wanted to take advantage of the structural columns, thus deciding to illuminate their edges with RGB LED ribbon tape light. With each column on each floor on its own DMX address, Streamline tied together the columns & walls all via touch screen control. As part of the complete venue project, Pereira & his team also incorporated lighting designs throughout the mall. Almost one mile of highpowered, 120V LED ribbon tape light was installed throughout the mall to bring everything together.<\/p><p><em>Visit <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.mondodr.com\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https:\/\/www.mondodr.com\"><em><strong>MONDO-DR<\/strong><\/em><\/a><em> for more international entertainment news. <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.streamlinesystemsltd.com\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https:\/\/www.streamlinesystemsltd.com\"><em><strong>Streamline Systems<\/strong><\/em><\/a><em> has 50+ years of combined experience in the AVL industry.<\/em><\/p><p><\/p>"
