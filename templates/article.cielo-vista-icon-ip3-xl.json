The team started small, using the new IRiS® ICON™ IP3 XL panels as an extension of their set design and stacking them into 5 columns on the stage. As they gained experience, they played around with a variety of content, and reconfigured the panels for different sets.<\/p><p>“Once you have a video wall you can’t go back,” said Alex Ringering, Production Manager at Cielo Vista Church. “It’s a night and day difference on stage and once the congregation sees it, it’s a whole other ball game.<\/p>",

They’re basically virtual set pieces and we’ve saved money and time on set builds since we started incorporating the walls.” IRiS ICON IP3 panels are built with adaptive HDR technology and come in 2 sizes (500x500mm or 500x1000mm) that can be combined in one build. They’re also designed to make setup a breeze thanks to quick-thumb locks and a light design at only 14.5 lbs for the XL.<\/p>",
