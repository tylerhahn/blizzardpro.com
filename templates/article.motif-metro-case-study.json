Shouldered by an array of talents, the company met several needs of this production. With the help of his team, Lighting Designer Simon Gauthier took care of designing, programming and bringing forth the lighting aspects of the production. For it, he teamed up with Graphics eMotion to project historically accurate animated pictures and 2D\/3D models reminiscent of the era on the outer and inner walls of the Colosseum, as well as on a see-through, 18x4-meter hologrammatic screen.<br\/><br\/>The visual experience was compounded by lighting and sound effects, as well as by narration in both Italian and English – all in all, an authentic time-travelling experience!<br\/><br\/>It was a digitally and historically outstanding exhibition, thanks to extensive international collaboration between the museums and exhibitions division of the Italian publishing house Electa; the management of the archaeological park; and a research team of historians, artists, architects and archaeologists. <\/p><p><\/p><p>Founded in 2003, Lumin-ART Productions is now a world leader in the performing arts sector. Its founder Simon Gauthier specializes in stage lighting. He has worked for major productions in Quebec, such as Cirque du Soleil, Igloofest, Céline Dion and Madonna. In collaboration with Graphics eMotion, he flew to Italy in order to light up one of Europe’s most ancient monuments, the Colosseum! For more information, visit: http:\/\/www.lumin-art.com<\/p>",
