Their loyal fanbase expects a punchy, time-warping show, and the TESLA team delivers a feast of eye candy to match its incredible aural experience.<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>“It’s clear, it’s smooth, it’s seamless,<\/strong>” says Robert (Bobby) Sanders about the IRiS® LED video wall, “I only need to use it at 30% power during shows and the saturation, image quality and contrast ratio are all impressive. We regularly show up to venues and when they see our wall they say, <strong>‘hey, your wall is better than ours!’<\/strong>” Bobby has been the lighting designer and production manager for the band since 2018. He manages the lighting and video wall pixel mapping separately and uses the NovaStar® VX6S all-in-one video controller and Arkaos MediaMaster system to layer content on the 3 displays separately, or span the width of the wall when needed.<\/p>",
